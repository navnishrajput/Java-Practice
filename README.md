# Java-Practice 


This repository contains my solutions to a series of Java programming problems, ranging from basic to advanced levels. The problems are designed to test foundational knowledge of Java, including data types, variables, type casting, and more.

## Problems Solved

### Basic Level (1-7)

These problems focus on fundamental concepts in Java.

| # | Problem Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | Write a Java program to declare and print all primitive data types. |
| 2 | Write a program to find the sum of two integers using variables. |
| 3 | Write a program to swap two numbers using a third variable. |
| 4 | Write a program to swap two numbers without using a third variable. |
| 5 | Write a program to find the ASCII value of a character. |
| 6 | Write a program to check whether a number is positive, negative, or zero. |
| 7 | Write a program to print default values of instance variables in a class. |

### Intermediate Level (8-14)

This section covers more complex topics, including type casting, autoboxing, and static variables.

| # | Problem Description |
|---|---|
| 8 | Write a program to demonstrate implicit and explicit type casting. |
| 9 | Write a program to demonstrate autoboxing and unboxing. |
| 10| Write a program to find the area of a circle using a final variable for PI. |
| 11| Write a program to show the difference between `char` and `String` data types. |
| 12| Write a program to demonstrate type promotion in arithmetic operations. |
| 13| Write a program to show the difference between static and instance variables. |
| 14| Write a program to use wrapper class methods to convert numbers to binary and hexadecimal. |

### Advanced Level (15-20)

These problems delve into more advanced and nuanced topics like memory management, type inference, and multithreading.

| # | Problem Description |
|---|---|
| 15| Write a program to show memory allocation difference between primitive and reference variables. |
| 16| Write a program to demonstrate the use of a `static final` variable (constant). |
| 17| Write a program to use `var` (Java 10+) for type inference. |
| 18| Write a program to demonstrate numeric overflow in Java. |
| 19| Write a program to check if a `long` value can be stored in a `float` variable and display the result. |
| 20| Write a program to declare a `volatile` variable and explain its use in multithreading. |
